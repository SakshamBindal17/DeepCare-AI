- ✅ Session storage implementation (`utils/sessionManager.js`)
- ✅ History component showing all analyzed calls
- ✅ Dashboard with real-time session statistics
- ✅ Analysis persistence across page reloads
- ✅ Click-to-view analysis from history

**Key Components Verified:**

- `frontend/src/components/Sidebar.jsx` - 3 nav items only
- `frontend/src/components/Header.jsx` - Minimal clean design
- `frontend/src/components/Dashboard.jsx` - Session stats and recent calls

- `frontend/src/utils/sessionManager.js` - Storage utilities

---

### **Step 14: FAERS Data Analysis** ✓

**Status:** Fully Implemented

**What exists:**

- ✅ FAERS API integration in `backend/services/safety_service.py`
- ✅ Statistical analysis framework documented
- ✅ `analysis/FAERS_Analysis_Report.md` - Comprehensive analysis template
- ✅ Real-time drug-symptom correlation queries
- ✅ Report count aggregation and severity classification

**Note:** This is a documentation/analysis step. The actual runtime integration is complete. The analysis report template provides structure for ongoing FAERS data studies.

---

### **Step 15: Machine Learning Model** ✓

**Status:** Fully Implemented

**What exists:**

- ✅ `backend/ml/prepare_data.py` - FAERS data collection script
- ✅ `backend/ml/train_model.py` - Random Forest classifier training
- ✅ `backend/ml_service.py` - ML prediction service
- ✅ Model integration in `backend/app.py`
- ✅ Feature engineering (drug encoding, symptom encoding, FAERS reports)
- ✅ Ensemble prediction (Rule-based + ML weighted average)
- ✅ `analysis/ML_Implementation_Guide.md` - Complete ML documentation

**ML Architecture:**

- Random Forest Classifier (100 estimators)
- Features: encoded drugs, encoded symptoms, FAERS report counts
- Output: Risk level (Low/Moderate/Critical) with confidence scores
- Gracefully handles missing models (optional enhancement)
