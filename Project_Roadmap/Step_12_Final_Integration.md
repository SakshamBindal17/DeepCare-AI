# Step 12: Final Integration & QA

## Objective
Put everything together and run the final tests.

## Actions

1.  **End-to-End Test**:
    *   Upload a real audio file from `Audio_Recordings/`.
    *   Watch the pipeline: Transcript appears -> Entities highlighted -> Risk Score calculated -> Audio syncs.

2.  **Manual Verification Log**:
    *   Create `tests/manual_verification.md`.
    *   Document 3-5 test cases (e.g., "Clear Audio", "Mumbled Audio", "No Symptoms").

3.  **Code Cleanup**:
    *   Remove temporary print statements.
    *   Ensure comments are clear.

## Verification
*   Ensure your virtual environment is active (`.\venv\Scripts\activate`).
*   The project should be ready for demo.
